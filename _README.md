# Astonishing Mosquito

> Are you someone who turns the sound off in games because it's just too annoying? What if it didn't need to be that way? In fact, what if the music was the deciding factor in how difficult your game play would be? The ChoZen syncs music with gaming, where game difficulty is directly determined by the user's chosen song and its tempo, tone, and frequency. Tee up your favorite playlist for hours of addictive play and listening.
